The Steerable Pyramid is a multi-scale, multi-orientation image
decomposition that provides a useful front-end for many computer
vision and image-processing applications [2,3].  The transformation is
a type of overcomplete Wavelet transform (specifically, it is an
approximation of a "tight frame").  It has the advantage that the
subbands are both translation- and rotation-invariant.

The filter bank used to construct the pyramid is polar-separable in
the Fourier domain.  The scale tuning of the filters is constrained by
a recursive system diagram (described below).  The orientation tuning
is constrained by requiring the property of steerability [1].  A set
of filters form a steerable basis if they 1) are rotated copies of
each other, and 2) a copy of the filter at any orientation may be
computed as a linear combination of the basis filters.  The simplest
examples of steerable filters is a set of N+1 Nth-order directional
derivatives.

In addition to having steerable orientation subbands, the transform we
describe is designed to be "self-inverting" (i.e., it is a "tight
frame"), and is approximately aliasing-free.  Most importantly, the
pyramid can be designed to produce any number of orientation bands,
k.  The resulting transform will be overcomplete by a factor of
4k/3.    The basic system diagram is illustrated below:

   ---- H0 ------------------+------------------------H0 ----
     |                                                    |
     -- L0 --- Bi -----------o---------------- Bi --- L0 --
            |                                      |
            -- L1 -- 2v -----*---------- 2^ -- L1 --

   H0: highpass initialization filter.  L0: lowpass initialization filter.
   Bi: set of k steerable bandpass filters.  L1: lowpass filter. 
   2v: downsample by 2.   2^: upsample by 2.  +: highpass coefficients
   o: oriented bandpass coefficients.  *: lowpass coefficients.  
   Pyramid recursion is achieved by inserting the subportion of the diagram 
	containing the Bi and L1 branches at the location of the *.

======================================================================
The C software provided in this distribution will build, manipulate,
and reconstruct steerable pyramid decompositions.  Please see
README.functions for a list of the function prototypes and
descriptions.  

We also provide a set of demonstration programs that build and display
steerable pyramids.  These are written for UNIX/X-windows platforms
(sorry, no PC or Mac versions yet).

*******>>> As of 4/97, there is also MatLab code available for
manipulating Steerable (and other) pyramids.  Check the web site at
www.cis.upenn.edu/~eero/steerpyr.html.

To get a copy of the C source code, create the software library, and run
the demos:

0) Ftp the source from ftp.cis.upenn.edu (IP address 158.130.12.3),
   from file pub/eero/steerpyr.tar.Z.  This is a unix-compressed
   "tar" file -- don't forget to put ftp into binary mode.
1) unpack the compressed tarfile:
	> cd <directory-where-you-want-this-code>
	> uncompress steerpyr.tar.Z
	> tar xvf steerpyr.tar
2) Compile:
	> cd Src
	> make
	[you may need to modify the pathnames in the Makefile] 
3) Run demo programs (UNIX/X-windows only):
	> cd ../Demo
	> show_pfilter -f spfilter.3
	> show_pyramid -f spfilter.1 -p image2 -l 3 -s 0
	> show_steer -f spfilter.3 -p image2 -l 1

Executing any of the demo programs with NO arguments will give a list
of arguments.  For the latter two programs, the "-l" argument is limited
to be less than floor(log2(D/9)), where D is the smallest dimension of
the input image.  Demo programs are as follows:

show_pfilter -f filter_file
   display the filter kernels from the "filter_file" in an X window:
	Top row: L1, L0, H0.  
	Bottom row: oriented kernels B_k.
   We provide 3 filter files, which are described below.

show_pyramid -f filter_file -p image_file -l numlevels -s subband
   decompose the image in the file "image_file" into a pyramid using
   the filters in "filter_file".  "numlevels" specifies the number of
   pyramid levels (i.e., scales) in the decomposition.  An X window
   will appear containing the following: 
	1) upper left: the reconstructed image (nearly identical to 
	   the original) 
	2) upper right: highpass residual image
	3) bottom, left to right: subbands at a fixed orientation (specified 
	   by the -s parameter, a number between 0 and N-1, where N 
	   is the number of orientation bands), shown at each scale, and
	4) bottom right: the lowpass residual.

show_steer -f filter_file -p image_file -l numlevel
   display a movie (containing 30 frames) of a continuously rotating,
   steered (interpolated) subband at a scale specified by "numlevel" 
   (numbering starts at 0).


FILTERS: several filter sets are provided:
   spfilter.0 - non-oriented bandpass filters.  Use as a
	"self-inverting" replacement for  the Laplacian pyramid.
   spfilter.1 - 2-orientation-band filter set.  These are essentially
	first derivative filters.
   spfilter.3 - 4-orientation-band filter set.  Third derivatives.

IMAGES: Two example images are provided with the source code: 
   image1 - a "zone plate" image, providing all orientations and spatial frequencies.
   image2 - a photograph of Albert Einstein.  
The demonstration programs will only operate on grayscale images, and
the display code only works on framebuffers at least 8bits deep.  The
demo programs will read two file formats:
  1) ASCII PGM (this is read/writable by the XV image utility).
  2) An internal "matrix" format, which consists of an ascii file containing
	a) Two integers (separated by whitespace) containing the number of rows
	   and columns.
        b) a space-delimited set of floating point numbers listed
                in row order  (i.e. from left to right) where the top
                row is given first.  The maximum number will be displayed
                as white, and the minimum will be displayed as black.
